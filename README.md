# In-Pipe Bot
A Long-Term Project done as a Core of Robotix Club ( The Robotics and Automation Club of IITH). The project focuses
on identifying|inspecting the cracks at the inner surface of industrial pipes.
[**OpenCv.ipynb**](OpenCV.ipynb) is the implementation of crack detection using in-built functions of OpenCV library.
While [**CNNs.ipynb**](CNNs.ipynb) is the implementation using Convolutional Neural Network, trained on 20,000 Positive and
20,000 Negative images obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunrk7/surface-crack-detection)
The above implementation using CNNs is trained to identify cracks on **Concrete Surfaces**.
